***Ian Mcharg*** made GIS maps using layers of transparent plastic, each plastic layer, roads, forests, views, was one aspect of a landscape, and together the thick layered study allowed him to see, if in a slightly muddy way, something about the relationships between all those aspects. Such a *suitability analysis* is based on relecting on the relationships between opportunities and contraints for development.

One of the excitements in a GIS study is that you can combine unexpected datasets of a place- social, politcal, ecological and risk data allow one to see unexpected relationships.

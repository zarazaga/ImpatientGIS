***Ian Mcharg*** made GIS maps using layers of transparent plastic, each plastic layer, roads, forests, views, was one aspect of a landscape, and together the thick layered study allowed him to see, if in a slightly muddy way, something about the relationships between all those aspects. Such a *suitability analysis* is based on relecting on the relationships between opportunities and contraints for development. Jump into GIS by making an Ian McHarg-style suitability development study, bringing together multiple layers of data about a place. One of the excitements in a GIS study is that you can combine unexpected datasets of a place- social, politcal, ecological and risk data allow one to see unexpected relationships.

Jump in! First search the internet for *shapefiles* about *health* in *Bostwana*. 



You search for Botswana, shapefile, health, and you find the *Bostwana Humnaitarian Data Exchange*. That sounds promising. Narrowing the format options to *zipped shapefiles* reduces the length of the list. I downloaded *Botswana-healthsites* and . Try to avoid raster data which shows, for example population density per-pixel.

*note: Each chapter builds up an example study to follow. But you can always choose to create a similar study, using a location or question that is more interesting to you.*

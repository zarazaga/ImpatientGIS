## Introduction



### Installling ArcGIS Pro
The license for ArcGIS Pro is embedded into an arcGIS online account.  It seems confusing- why is an online account needed in order to get a desktop software? This is because ArcGIS Pro is fully integrated with the online software- you will access data throught the online portal, and can save and share your work through the online platform. Tools and tasks are visually similar. Think of it as two access points to one platform.  
The online user account is needed in order to sign on to Pro, and is individual to each user account, rather than to each computer. This means a downloaded copy can be loaded on any computer, but only people like you who have a license can sign into it. 

**is there a free 180 days with this book?  I will need help with instructions for non-students!**

From your *ArcGIS online* account:
Download the ArcGIS Pro installer from the *My settings* page in your user profile.  

1.	Log into your *ArcGIS Online* account
2.	Go to "*My settings*" [top right]
3.	Choose “*Licenses*”
4.	Click the download link next to ArcGIS Pro

### Is ArcGIS different from ArcMap and ArcGIS Pro?
ArcGIS is a collective name for many different GIS softares made by ESRI. It has two primary desktop versions: ArcMap and ArcGIS Pro. In this book we will often shorten the name to '*Pro*'.  
Once you know how to work with one GIS software you will understand the structure of many others. Although it is written for this software, many of the instructions, ideas and tools here can be adapted to other GIS packages including open source software and older GIS packages. 

ArcGIS Pro (like ArcMap) only works on Windows. A mac will need bootcamp or parallels: https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/get-started/run-pro-on-a-mac.htm

### Backup data for the exercises
Gathering data is a primary part of doing geospatial work. Learning GIS here will include gathering and creating datasets. But a backup copy of the data is available at escri.com/impatientGIS. 

### ArcGIS Pro Help
Software changes fast. It's frustrating. As soon as one learn's something, a new aspect will be developed.  But you have to start somewhere. This book will not teach you everything you need to know- rather it is intended to give you enough knowledge to ask the right questions. The greatest source for using ArcGIS Pro is the ESRI help webiste. But often it is hard to understand the instructions until you have some GIS experience. In some ways the aim of this book it to make you comfortable making use of, and asking specific and difficult questions from, ESRI help.

## Chapter 1
# import point and polygon data into ArcGIS Pro

Ian Mcharg made GIS maps using layers of transparent plastic, each plastic layer, roads, forests, views, was one aspect of a landscape, and together the thick layered study allowed him to see, if in a slightly muddy way, something about the relationships between all those aspects. Such a *suitability analysis* is based on relecting on the relationships between opportunities and contraints for development. Jump into GIS by making an Ian McHarg-style suitability development study, bringing together multiple layers of data about a place. One of the excitements in a GIS study is that you can combine unexpected datasets of a place- social, politcal, ecological and risk data allow one to see unexpected relationships.



*note: Each chapter builds up an example study to follow. But you can always choose to create a similar study, using a location or question that is more interesting to you.*
